## Overview

Elasticsearch is a distributed, JSON-based RESTful search and analytics engine. Elasticsearch supports many type of of searches, for example structured, unstructured geo and metric searches and lets you aggregate the search data for easier scaling. It is based on Apache Lucene and makes use of inverted indices which allows a fast processing of full text queries. According to [DB-Engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/search+engine), Elasticsearch is the most popular search engine.

### Key Features

Elasticsearch is a comprehensive software that provides many features. Some of the key features are:

- **Clustering and high availability**: An Elasticsearch cluster is a collection of nodes that holds all of the data and provides indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.
- **Automatic node recovery**: In case a node leaves the cluster, the master node replaces the node with a replica and rebalances the shards.
- **Automatic data rebalancing**: The master node rebalances the cluster by moving the shards between the nodes.
- **Snapshot and restore**: A snapshot of individual indices or the entire cluster can be taken and stored in a repository on a shared file system (for example, a S3 repository). See [Backup](#backup) for more information.
- **Alerting**: The Elasticsearch query language allows to identify any changes and create an alert on it. The corresponding notification can then be sent to email, IBM Resilient, Jira, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, ServiceNow and Slack.
- **Different APIs**: Elasticsearch provides multiple [REST](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/rest-apis.html) APIs, for example [CRUD](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/docs.html) and [Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/search.html) APIs.
- **Flexibility**: While Elasticsearch ist best known for its advanced search capabilities, it also suited for other needs, like document storage, time series analysis, metrics and geospatial analytics.
- **Full-text search**: Elasticsearch is capable of doing full-text searches. It uses inverted indexes and supports tunable relevance scoring, advanced query DSL and a wide range of search enhancing features.

A complete list of features can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/features).

For more information, see the [Elasticsearch guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/index.html).

> **_IMPORTANT:_** The OSB-Elasticsearch sets XMS and XMX (minimum and maximum heap size) of the Java Virtual Machine Options to 46% (Ã¤nderbar?).

This project is part of our service broker project. For documentation of the service broker see [evoila/osb-docs](https://github.com/evoila/osb-docs).
The OSB-Elasticsearch offers different service plans which vary in allocated memory, cpu, disc-size and number of vms created for Elasticsearch.

### Software used by OSB-Elasticsearch
- **Elasticsearch**: 6.8.0, 7.7.1

### Cluster

An Elasticsearch cluster can consist of a single node, serving multiple purposes or multiple nodes that can be configured as general nodes or as nodes for specific roles. A general node is responsible for ingesting and filtering requests, processing HTTP requests and storing the data. If not specified, a node will serve as a general node.
If the cluster consists of multiple nodes, they can be assigned specific roles instead of being used for multiple purposes.
The following nodes are supported by the OSB-Elasticsearch which can be defined in the plan of the service catalog:
- **General node**: A node that serves as a multi-purpose-node (functionality of all specific nodes combined). If many resources are needed, splitting a node into multiple nodes with different roles is recommended.
- **Master-eligible node**: A node that serves as master node. A master node is responsible for lightweight cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. In case of a failure of the master node, the remaining master-eligible nodes elect a different master-eligible node as master node. 
- **Coordinating node**: A coordinating node is responsible for receiving client requests, forwarding them to the data nodes that hold the data and combining the data nodes results into a single global resultset. Coordinating nodes have a medium compute, memory and network usage.
- **Data node**: Data nodes hold the shards containing the documents that have been indexed. Data nodes are responsible for handling operations like CRUD, search and aggregations. They have a high storage, memory and compute usage and a medium usage of network resources.
- **Ingest node**: Ingest nodes can execute pre-processing pipelines, composed of one or more ingest processors. For example, an ingest node can be used for filtering a PUT request by the client which it receives from a coordinating node. Ingest nodes have a high compute and a medium memory and network usage.

> **_IMPORTANT:_** The amount of master-eligible nodes together with the general nodes must be odd.


The following image shows the data processing flow of the nodes:

Machine learning nodes are not supported by OSB-Elasticsearch (?wass passiert, wenn man trotzdem ne machine learning node in den plan haut?). Further information about nodes can be found in the [Elasticsearch guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/modules-node.html).

## TODO Requirements
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
- Memory: A node should have at least 4 GB of RAM (recommended minimum is 8 GB) but not greater than 64 GB (see [Heap: Sizing and Swapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/heap-sizing.html))
- Storage: For memory-intense search workloads a ram to storage workload of 1:16..(?TODO)

## TODO How to
### Create a Service Instance

A service instance can be created manually via the CLI-Command
```
cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE [-b BROKER] [-c PARAMETERS_AS_JSON] [-t TAGS]
```

- **SERVICE** will be the name of the service broker which is likely going to be **osb-elasticsearch**
- **PLAN** is a plan offered by the service.
- **SERVICE_INSTANCE** the name of the service instance, can be chosen freely.
- **PARAMETERS_AS_JSON** contains additional parameters (?parameters drin lassen? funktioniert NOCH nicht) in JSON-format.

For more information see [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/v6/create-service.html)

Aternatively, if there is a dashboard set up (like the Stratos Dashboard for example), it can be used to create a service instance.

### Update a Service Instance

A service instance can be updated manually via the CLI-Command
```
cf update-service SERVICE_INSTANCE [-p NEW_PLAN] [-c PARAMETERS_AS_JSON] [-t TAGS] [--upgrade]
```

- **SERVICE_INSTANCE** is be the name of the previously created service instance.
- **PARAMETERS_AS_JSON** contains additional parameters (?parameters drin lassen? funktioniert NOCH nicht) in JSON-format.

For more information see [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/v6/update-service.html)


Aternatively, if there is a dashboard set up (like the Stratos Dashboard for example), it can be used to update a service instance.

Keep in mind that **previous values will be overwritten**. In order to see the existing parameters you can use a dashboard or acquire the parameters via cli (see [Acquiring Service Instance Parameters](#acquiring-service-instance-parameters)).

### Create a Service Binding

A binding can be created manually via the CLI-Command 
```
cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE [-c PARAMETERS_AS_JSON] [--binding-name BINDING_NAME]
```

- **APP_NAME** ist the name of the previously created app that gets the binding injected.
- **SERVICE_INSTANCE** is be the name of the previously created service instance.
- **PARAMETERS_AS_JSON** contains additional parameters in JSON-format.


For more information see [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/v6/bind-service.html).
After creating a binding, the app has to be restarted for the changes to take effect. (??Copy from git repo md)

Aternatively, if there is a dashboard set up (like the Stratos Dashboard for example), it can be used to create a service binding.

### Acquiring Service Instance Parameters

The current parameters of a service instance can be retrieved via cli:

1. ```cf service --guid **SERVICE_INSTANCE**```
2. ```cf curl v3/service_instances/**SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID**/parameters```
3. A JSON with the parameters will be returned.

- **SERVICE_INSTANCE** is be the name of the previously created service instance.
- **SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID** is the guid of the service instance which is acquired in step 1. 


### Backup

TODO Step-by-step Workaround

Prerequisites:
- Cloud Foundry CLI installed and logged in
- Bosh CLI installed and logged in

Step-by-step guide:
1. Get the service GUID via the CLI command: ```cf service --guid **SERVICE_INSTANCE**```. **SERVICE_INSTANCE** must be replaced with the name of the OSB-Elasticsearch instance.
2. Get the manifest from Bosh via the CLI command ```bosh manifest -d sb-**GUID**``` and save it in a file. **GUID** must be replaced with the GUID retreived in step 1.
3. Depending on the release version of the OSB-Elasticsearch, there a two different approaches for step 3:
     - Version x (?Version rausfinden) and earlier: For **every** instance group in the manifest, add the following field to the properties:
     ```
     elasticsearch:
      backup: 
        s3:
          clients:
            default:
              access_key: **S3_ACCESS_KEY**
              secret_key: **S3_SECRET KEY**
    ```
      **S3_ACCESS_KEY** must be replaced with the access key for the S3 storage.
      **S3_SECRET_KEY** must be replaced with the secret key for the S3 storage.
     - Version y (?Version rausfinden) and later: For **every** instance group in the manifest, add the following field to the properties:
     ```
     elasticsearch:
      backup: 
        s3:
          clients:
          - name: **CLIENT_NAME**
            access_key: **S3_ACCESS_KEY**
            secret_key: **S3_SECRET KEY**
    ```
      **CLIENT_NAME** is the name of the backup client, which can be set here (using the name **default** is recommended).
      **S3_ACCESS_KEY** must be replaced with the access key for the S3 storage.
      **S3_SECRET_KEY** must be replaced with the secret key for the S3 storage.
4. Deploy the new manifest via ```bosh deploy -d sb-**GUID** **FILENAME**```. **GUID** must be replaced with the GUID retreived in step 1. **FILENAME** must be the name of the file that was retreived in step 2.
5. Get the credentials by creating a service key via the command ```cf csk **SERVICE_INSTANCE** **SERVICE_KEY_NAME** -c '{"clientMode":"superuser"}'```. **SERVICE_INSTANCE** is the name of the OSB-Elasticsearch instance. **SERVICE_KEY_NAME** is the name of the service key which can be set.
6. Create a new repository via the Elasticsearch API (see [snapshot repository API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/7.7/repository-s3-repository.html))
7. Finally a snapshot can be created via the Elasticsearch API (see [Take snapshot API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/snapshots-take-snapshot.html))

To list all snapshots you can make the request 
```
GET /_snapshot/**REPOSITORY_NAME**/**SNAPSHOT_NAME**
```
**REPOSITORY_NAME** is the name of a repository. Alternatively, the wildcard **\*** or **_all** can be used to list 

For more information, see [Get snapshot API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/get-snapshot-repo-api.html).
TODO

The following fields can/must be provided for a client:
| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| name | string | - | The name of the client. Value MUST be set |
| access_key | string | - | The access key of the S3 client. Value MUST be set |
| secret_key | string | - | The secret key of the S3 client. Value MUST be set |
| endpoint | string | "s3.amazonaws<span>.com</span>" | The S3 service endpoint to connect to |
| read_timeout | string | "50s" | Socket timeout for connecting to S3. The value should specify the unit (e.g. "5s") |
| max_retries | integer | 3 | Number of retries when a request fails |
| use_throttle_retries | boolean | true | Whether retries should be throttled |

Further information about using the Elasticsearch API to create a snapshot can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/create-snapshot-api.html)

It is important to keep in mind that there is enough space for Elasticearch data and backups. The size of the backup corresponds to the size of the indices (?check compression?) which can be checked by sending a request to the Elasticsearch API (see [Index Stats API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/indices-stats.html)):
```
GET /_stats
```

The size of a plan can be scaled up afterwards but this will copy the disk.

### Change SSL Certificates

The certificates expire after 365 day. If a certificate is about to expire, contact the operator of the Service Broker to renew the certificates.

If Bosh DNS is used, the certificates are stored in Credhub and can be renewed there. If the root CA is still valid, the certificate can simply be deleted and the new certificate can be used via `bosh manifest`and `bosh deploy`. If the root CA expires, it is necessary to concatenate old and new certificates, for example via [https://github.com/pivotal/credhub-release/blob/main/docs/ca-rotation.md](https://github.com/pivotal/credhub-release/blob/main/docs/ca-rotation.md).</br>
If the IP variant is used and the root CA still valid, it is sufficient to use `bosh recreate`. For changing the root CA, it also has to be concatenated and multiple deploys have to be made.

## Settings
This section covers different settings that can be made for the OSB-Elasticsearch when creating a service binding.

### Ingress and egress binding

When you create a new service binding in cloudfoundry, you can provide an client mode, either ingress or egress. The broker automatically filters the nodes and returns only the IPs corresponding to the client mode passed. If you do not specify a client mode, egress will be used.

Example:

`cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c '{"clientMode":"ingress"}'`

`cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c '{"clientMode":"egress"}'`

### Built-In user credentials

An Elasticsearch installation includes a small number of built-in users for example to have access to Kibana. In order to obtain these special access data, a new binding must be created and the corresponding client mode must be specified.

To obtain **Admin** credentials use `cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c '{"clientMode":"superuser"}'`

To obtain **Kibana** credentials use `cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c '{"clientMode":"kibana"}'`

To obtain **Logstash** credentials use `cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c '{"clientMode":"logstash"}'`

### OSB-Elasticsearch crashed

If the service broker crashes, the operator should be contacted.

### A Elasticsearch instance crashed (?anwendbar auf elasticsearch?)

As long as the majority of MongoDB instances is running after another instance failed, the database is still functional. The Bosh director will detect the failure and try to repair the broken instance. If an automatic repair of the instance is not possible, it has to be fixed manually.

The following causes can lead to a failure:
- IaaS problems with VMs, network or storage.
- Storage space completely occupied.

Access to the VM via [Bosh CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/) is required for debugging. First, the following two files have to be sourced within the VM.

```
/var/vcap/jobs/mongodb/env
/var/vcap/jobs/mongodb/bin/post-deploy
```
Start the Mongo cli ($MONGO) as admin (password can be found in **post-deploy** or CredHub for example) --authenticationDatabase admin --host $MONGODB_HOST.

For example:
```
$MONGO -u admin -p ADMIN_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin --host $MONGODB_HOST
```
Afterwards the state of the cluster can be retrieved with the command `rs.status()`. 
Additional information can be retrieved with the command `rs.isMaster()`.

**Majority** of nodes (including primary) failed and can't be reinitialized:</br>
In this case no secondary can be elected as primary. The only options are reinitializing the replica set or [reconfiguring](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/reconfigure-replica-set-with-unavailable-members/) it.

In many cases it is also possible, to retrieve the oplog of a failed primary with [`mongodump`](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/mongodump/) using the `--oplog` flag and recover the database by replaying the oplog with [`mongorestore`](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/mongorestore/) using the `--oplogReplay` flag.
Currently, replaying an oplog is not supported by the Backup Manager. Changes to the database while doing a backup **may not** be recorded.

The following logs are relevant for troubleshooting:

```
/var/vcap/sys/log/mongodb/server.stderr.log
/var/vcap/sys/log/mongodb/server.stdout.log
```

While performing maintenance on single replica set members, each node has to be restarted as standalone. Afterwards, maintenance can be done on the node and then be restarted as a member of the replica set. The primary should come last. More information about maintaining replica set members can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members/).

If the error **cannot be fixed**, a new instance has to be created and restored by using a backup.

### The size of the backup was bigger than expected (and failed) and now all of my storage space is occupied

In this case, contact the operator.
